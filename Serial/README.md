Small utility package for reading serial output from VariYo.

Install instructions:

Optionally, crate and activate a new virtual environment if you dont want to install into system wide python by running
```
python.exe -m venv env
.env/Scripts/activate
```

Then install the package using pip
```
python.exe -m pip install './VariYO/Serial'
```

Run and enjoy
```
python.exe -m serial_reader
```

Note to self:
Obviously if you are making any changes in the code you need to reinstall the package...
